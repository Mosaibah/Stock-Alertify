## Overview 
Stock investments provide one of the highest returns in the market. Even though they 
are volatile in nature, one can visualize share prices and other statistical factors, 
which helps keen investors carefully decide on which company they want to spend their 
earnings on.

This project will allow users to retrieve the latest stock market prices and create 
alert rules by setting a threshold price for the stock they are interested in and 
receiving alerts if stocks cross those thresholds.
